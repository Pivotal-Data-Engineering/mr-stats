# mr-stats
* simple collection and charting of linux system stats data (no cut&paste required)
* all of the code is shell/sql scripts, no compilation required, no web setup
* this repo is oriented towards analysis of a GreenplumDB or HAWQ MPP cluster
* therefore, we include analysis of pg_log and MPP process activity via "pidstat"
* the README in each directory explains specific installation and analysis procedures
