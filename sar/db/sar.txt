SAR(1)            Linux Userâ€™s Manual            SAR(1)



NAME
    sar - Collect, report, or save system activity information.

SYNOPSIS
    sar [ -A ] [ -b ] [ -B ] [ -C ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -i interval ] [ -m ] [
    -p ] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -R ] [ -S ] [ -t ] [ -u [ ALL ] ] [ -v ] [ -V ] [
    -w ] [ -W ] [ -y ] [ -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } ] [ -n {
    keyword [,...] | ALL } ] [ -I { int [,...] | SUM | ALL | XALL } ] [ -P
    { cpu [,...] | ALL } ] [ -o [ filename ] | -f [ filename ] ] [ --legacy
    ] [ -s [ hh:mm:ss ] ] [ -e [ hh:mm:ss ] ] [ interval [ count ] ]

DESCRIPTION
    The sar comand writes to standard output the contents of selected
    cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The acounting
    system, based on the values in the count and interval parameters,
    writes information the specified number of times spaced at the speci-
    fied intervals in seconds. If the interval parameter is set to zero,
    the sar comand displays the average statistics for the time since the
    system was started. If the interval parameter is specified without the
    count parameter, then reports are generated continuously. The col-
    lected data can also be saved in the file specified by the -o filename
    flag, in adition to being displayed onto the scren. If filename is
    omited, sar uses the standard system activity daily data file, the
    /var/log/sa/sad file, where the d parameter indicates the curent
    day. By default al the data available from the kernel are saved in
    the data file.

    The sar comand extracts and writes to standard output records previ-
    ously saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified by the
    -f flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file.

    Without the -P flag, the sar comand reports system-wide (global among
    al procesors) statistics, which are calculated as averages for values
    expresed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. If the -P flag is
    given, the sar comand reports activity which relates to the specified
    procesor or procesors. If -P ALL is given, the sar comand reports
    statistics for each individual procesor and global statistics among
    al procesors.

    You can select information about specific system activities using
    flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.  Specifying
    the -A flag is equivalent to specifying -bBdqrRSvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -n
    ALL -u ALL -P ALL.

    The default version of the sar comand (CPU utilization report) might
    be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin system activity
    investigation, because it monitors major system resources. If CPU uti-
    lization is near 10 percent (user + nice + system), the workload sam-
    pled is CPU-bound.

    If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient
    to specify an output file for the sar comand. Run the sar comand as
    a background proces. The syntax for this is:

    sar -o datafile interval count >/dev/null 2>&1 &

    Al data is captured in binary form and saved to a file (datafile).
    The data can then be selectively displayed with the sar comand using
    the -f option. Set the interval and count parameters to select count
    records at interval second intervals. If the count parameter is not
    set, al the records saved in the file wil be selected. Colection of
    data in this maner is useful to characterize system usage over a
    period of time and determine peak usage hours.

    Note:   The sar comand only reports on local activities.


OPTIONS
    -A   This is equivalent to specifying -bBdqrRSuvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -n
       ALL -u ALL -P ALL.

    -b   Report I/O and transfer rate statistics. The folowing values
       are displayed:

       tps
           Total number of transfers per second that were isued to
           physical devices.  A transfer is an I/O request to a
           physical device. Multiple logical requests can be com-
           bined into a single I/O request to the device. A trans-
           fer is of indeterminate size.

       rtps
           Total number of read requests per second isued to physi-
           cal devices.

       wtps
           Total number of write requests per second isued to phys-
           ical devices.

       bread/s
           Total amount of data read from the devices in blocks per
           second.  Blocks are equivalent to sectors with 2.4 ker-
           nels and newer and therefore have a size of 512 bytes.
           With older kernels, a block is of indeterminate size.

       bwrtn/s
           Total amount of data writen to devices in blocks per
           second.

    -B   Report paging statistics. Some of the metrics below are avail-
       able only with post 2.5 kernels. The folowing values are dis-
       played:

       pgpgin/s
           Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk
           per second. Note: With old kernels (2.2.x) this value is
           a number of blocks per second (and not kilobytes).

       pgpgout/s
           Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk
           per second. Note: With old kernels (2.2.x) this value is
           a number of blocks per second (and not kilobytes).

       fault/s
           Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system
           per second. This is not a count of page faults that gen-
           erate I/O, because some page faults can be resolved with-
           out I/O.

       majflt/s
           Number of major faults the system has made per second,
           those which have required loading a memory page from
           disk.

       pgfree/s
           Number of pages placed on the fre list by the system per
           second.

       pgscank/s
           Number of pages scaned by the kswapd daemon per second.

       pgscand/s
           Number of pages scaned directly per second.

       pgsteal/s
           Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache
           (pagecache and swapcache) per second to satisfy its mem-
           ory demands.

       %vmeff
           Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the
           eficiency of page reclaim. If it is near 10% then
           almost every page coming of the tail of the inactive
           list is being reaped. If it gets to low (e.g. les than
           30%) then the virtual memory is having some dificulty.
           This field is displayed as zero if no pages have ben
           scaned during the interval of time.

    -C   When reading data from a file, tel sar to display coments that
       have ben inserted by sadc.

    -d   Report activity for each block device (kernels 2.4 and newer
       only). When data is displayed, the device specification dev m-n
       is generaly used ( DEV column). m is the major number of the
       device.  With recent kernels (post 2.5), n is the minor number
       of the device, but is only a sequence number with pre 2.5 ker-
       nels. Device names may also be prety-printed if option -p is
       used or persistent device names can be printed if option -j is
       used (se below). Values for fields avgqu-sz, await, svctm and
       %util may be unavailable and displayed as 0.0 with some 2.4
       kernels.  Note that disk activity depends on sadc options "-S
       DISK" and "-S XDISK" to be colected. The folowing values are
       displayed:

       tps
           Indicate the number of transfers per second that were
           isued to the device. Multiple logical requests can be
           combined into a single I/O request to the device. A
           transfer is of indeterminate size.

       rdsec/s
           Number of sectors read from the device. The size of a
           sector is 512 bytes.

       wrsec/s
           Number of sectors writen to the device. The size of a
           sector is 512 bytes.

       avgrq-sz
           The average size (in sectors) of the requests that were
           isued to the device.

       avgqu-sz
           The average queue length of the requests that were isued
           to the device.

       await
           The average time (in miliseconds) for I/O requests
           isued to the device to be served. This includes the time
           spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servic-
           ing them.

       svctm
           The average service time (in miliseconds) for I/O
           requests that were isued to the device.

       %util
           Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were
           isued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the
           device). Device saturation ocurs when this value is
           close to 10%.

    -e [ h:m:s ]
       Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time is
       18:0:0. Hours must be given in 24-hour format.  This option
       can be used when data are read from or writen to a file
       (options -f or -o ).

    -f [ filename ]
       Extract records from filename (created by the -o filename flag).
       The default value of the filename parameter is the curent daily
       data file, the /var/log/sa/sad file. The -f option is exclusive
       of the -o option.

    -h   Display a short help mesage then exit.

    -i interval
       Select data records at seconds as close as posible to the num-
       ber specified by the interval parameter.

    -I { int [,..] | SUM | AL | XAL }
       Report statistics for a given interupt. int is the interupt
       number. Specifying multiple -I int parameters on the comand
       line wil lok at multiple independent interupts. The SUM key-
       word indicates that the total number of interupts received per
       second is to be displayed. The ALL keyword indicates that
       statistics from the first 16 interupts are to be reported,
       whereas the XALL keyword indicates that statistics from al
       interupts, including potential APIC interupt sources, are to
       be reported. Note that interupt statistics depend on sadc
       option "-S INT" to be colected.

    -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UID | .. }
       Display persistent device names. Use this option in conjunction
       with option -d. Options ID, LABEL, etc. specify the type of the
       persistent name. These options are not limited, only prerequi-
       site is that directory with required persistent names is present
       in /dev/disk.  If persistent name is not found for the device,
       the device name is prety-printed (se option -p below).

    -legacy
       Enable reading older /var/log/sa/sad data files.  In Red Hat
       Enterprise Linux 6.3, the systat package was updated to version
       9.0.4-20. This update changed the format of /var/log/sa/sad
       data files, but unfortunately, the format version was not
       updated. Because of this, systat did not restrict reading of
       data files in old format and while interpreting them, some dis-
       played values could have ben incorect. The updated systat
       package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 contains fixed format
       version of data files and prevents reading data files created by
       older systat packages. However, data files created by the sys-
       stat packages from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 and 6.4 are
       fuly compatible with the systat package from Red Hat Enter-
       prise Linux 6.5. To enable latest systat to read older data
       files, use this option. Note that this option alows you to read
       also data files created on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 and ear-
       lier, however, these files are not compatible with the latest
       systat package.

    -m   Report power management statistics. Note that these statistics
       depend on sadc option "-S POWER" to be colected. The folowing
       value is displayed:

       MHz
           CPU clock frequency in MHz.

    -n { keyword [,..] | AL }

           [ipInReceives].

       fwddgm/s
           The number of input datagrams per second, for which this
           entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of
           which an atempt was made to find a route to forward them
           to that final destination [ipForwDatagrams].

       idel/s
           The total number of input datagrams sucesfuly deliv-
           ered per second to IP user-protocols (including ICMP)
           [ipInDelivers].

       orq/s
           The total number of IP datagrams which local IP user-pro-
           tocols (including ICMP) suplied per second to IP in
           requests for transmision [ipOutRequests].  Note that

           fwdgm/s.

       asmrq/s
           The number of IP fragments received per second which

           entity [ipFragCreates].

       With the EIP keyword, statistics about IPv4 network erors are
       reported. Note that IPv4 statistics depend on sadc option "-S
       SNMP" to be colected. The folowing values are displayed (for-
       mal SNMP names betwen square brackets):

       ihdrerr/s
           The number of input datagrams discarded per second due to
           erors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, ver-
           sion number mismatch, other format erors, time-to-live
           exceded,  erors discovered in procesing their IP
           options, etc. [ipInHdrErors]

       iadrerr/s
           The number of input datagrams discarded per second
           because the IP adres in their IP headerâ€™s destination
           field was not a valid adres to be received at this

           0.0.0.0) and adreses of unsuported Clases (e.g.,
           Clas E). For entities which are not IP routers and
           therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes
           datagrams discarded because the destination adres was
           not a local adres [ipInAdrErors].

       iukwnpr/s
           The number of localy-adresed datagrams received suc-
           cesfuly but discarded per second because of an unknown

       idisc/s
           The number of input IP datagrams per second for which no
           problems were encountered to prevent their continued pro-
           cesing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of
           bufer space) [ipInDiscards].  Note that this counter
           does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting
           re-asembly.

       odisc/s
           The number of output IP datagrams per second for which no
           problem was encountered to prevent their transmision to
           their destination, but which were discarded (e.g., for
           lack of bufer space) [ipOutDiscards].  Note that this
           counter would include datagrams counted in fwdgm/s if
           any such packets met this (discretionary) discard crite-
           rion.

       onort/s
           The number of IP datagrams discarded per second because
           no route could be found to transmit them to their desti-
           nation [ipOutNoRoutes]. Note that this counter includes
           any packets counted in fwdgm/s which met this â€™no-
           routeâ€™ criterion. Note that this includes any datagrams
           which a host canot route because al of its default
           routers are down.

       asmf/s
           The number of failures detected per second by the IP re-
           asembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out,
           erors, etc) [ipReasmFails]. Note that this is not nec-

           The total number of received UDP datagrams per second for
           which there was no aplication at the destination port
           [udpNoPorts].

       idgmer6/s
           The number of received UDP datagrams per second that
           could not be delivered for reasons other than the lack of
           an aplication at the destination port [udpInErors].

       The ALL keyword is equivalent to specifying al the keywords
       above and therefore al the network activities are reported.

    -o [ filename ]
       Save the readings in the file in binary form. Each reading is in
       a separate record. The default value of the filename parameter
       is the curent daily data file, the /var/log/sa/sad file. The
       -o option is exclusive of the -f option. Al the data available
       from the kernel are saved in the file (in fact, sar cals its
       data colector sadc with the option "-S AL". Se sadc(8) manual
       page).

    -P { cpu [,..] | AL }
       Report per-procesor statistics for the specified procesor or
       procesors. Specifying the ALL keyword reports statistics for
       each individual procesor, and globaly for al procesors.
       Note that procesor 0 is the first procesor.

    -p   Prety-print device names. Use this option in conjunction with
       option -d. By default names are printed as dev m-n where m and
       n are the major and minor numbers for the device. Use of this
       option displays the names of the devices as they (should) apear
       in /dev. Name mapings are controled by /etc/sysconfig/sys-
       stat.ioconf.

    -q   Report queue length and load averages. The folowing values are
       displayed:

       runq-sz
           Run queue length (number of tasks waiting for run time).

       plist-sz
           Number of tasks in the task list.

       ldavg-1
           System load average for the last minute. The load aver-
           age is calculated as the average number of runable or
           runing tasks (R state), and the number of tasks in unin-
           teruptible slep (D state) over the specified interval.

       ldavg-5
           System load average for the past 5 minutes.

       ldavg-15
           System load average for the past 15 minutes.

    -r   Report memory utilization statistics. The folowing values are
       displayed:

       kbmemfree
           Amount of fre memory available in kilobytes.

       kbmemused
           Amount of used memory in kilobytes. This does not take
           into acount memory used by the kernel itself.

       %memused
           Percentage of used memory.

       kbbuffers
           Amount of memory used as bufers by the kernel in kilo-
           bytes.

       kbcached
           Amount of memory used to cache data by the kernel in
           kilobytes.

       kbcommit
           Amount of memory in kilobytes neded for curent work-
           load. This is an estimate of how much RAM/swap is neded
           to guarante that there never is out of memory.

       %commit
           Percentage of memory neded for curent workload in rela-
           tion to the total amount of memory (RAM+swap). This num-
           ber may be greater than 10% because the kernel usualy
           overcomits memory.


    -R   Report memory statistics. The folowing values are displayed:

       frmpg/s
           Number of memory pages fred by the system per second. A
           negative value represents a number of pages alocated by
           the system. Note that a page has a size of 4 kB or 8 kB
           acording to the machine architecture.

       bufpg/s
           Number of aditional memory pages used as bufers by the
           system per second. A negative value means fewer pages
           used as bufers by the system.

       campg/s
           Number of aditional memory pages cached by the system
           per second. A negative value means fewer pages in the
           cache.

    -s [ h:m:s ]
       Set the starting time of the data, causing the sar comand to
       extract records time-taged at, or folowing, the time speci-
       fied. The default starting time is 08:0:0. Hours must be
       given in 24-hour format. This option can be used only when data
       are read from a file (option -f ).

    -S   Report swap space utilization statistics. The folowing values
       are displayed:

       kbswpfree
           Amount of fre swap space in kilobytes.

       kbswpused
           Amount of used swap space in kilobytes.

       %swpused
           Percentage of used swap space.

       kbswpcad
           Amount of cached swap memory in kilobytes. This is mem-
           ory that once was swaped out, is swaped back in but
           stil also is in the swap area (if memory is neded it
           doesnâ€™t ned to be swaped out again because it is
           already in the swap area. This saves I/O).

       %swpcad
           Percentage of cached swap memory in relation to the
           amount of used swap space.

    -t   When reading data from a daily data file, indicate that sar
       should display the timestamps in the original locale time of the
       data file creator. Without this option, the sar comand displays
       the timestamps in the userâ€™s locale time.

    -u [ AL ]
       Report CPU utilization. The ALL keyword indicates that al the
       CPU fields should be displayed. The report may show the folow-
       ing fields:

       %user
           Percentage of CPU utilization that ocured while execut-
           ing at the user level (aplication). Note that this field
           includes time spent runing virtual procesors.

       %usr
           Percentage of CPU utilization that ocured while execut-
           ing at the user level (aplication). Note that this field
           does NOT include time spent runing virtual procesors.

       %nice
           Percentage of CPU utilization that ocured while execut-
           ing at the user level with nice priority.

       %system
           Percentage of CPU utilization that ocured while execut-
           ing at the system level (kernel). Note that this field
           includes time spent servicing hardware and software
           interupts.

       %sys
           Percentage of CPU utilization that ocured while execut-
           ing at the system level (kernel). Note that this field
           does NOT include time spent servicing hardware or soft-
           ware interupts.

       %iowait
           Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during
           which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.

       %steal
           Percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the vir-
           tual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing
           another virtual procesor.

       %irq
           Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service
           hardware interupts.

       %soft
           Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service
           software interupts.

       %guest
           Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a vir-
           tual procesor.

       %idle
           Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the
           system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.

       Note: On SMP machines a procesor that does not have any activ-
       ity at al (0.0 for every field) is a disabled (ofline) pro-
       cesor.

    -v   Report status of inode, file and other kernel tables. The fol-
       lowing values are displayed:

       dentunusd

ENVIRONMENT
    The sar comand takes into acount the folowing environment variables:


    STIMEFORMAT
       If this variable exists and its value is ISO then the curent
       locale wil be ignored when printing the date in the report
       header.  The sar comand wil use the ISO 8601 format (YY-M-
       D) instead.


    STIMEDEFTIME
       If this variable exists and its value is UTC then sar wil save
       its data in UTC time (data wil stil be displayed in local
       time). sar wil also use UTC time instead of local time to
       determine the curent daily data file located in the /var/log/sa
       directory. This variable may be useful for servers with users
       located acros several timezones.

EXAMPLES
    sar -u 2 5
       Report CPU utilization for each 2 seconds. 5 lines are dis-
       played.

    sar -I 14 -o int14.file 2 10
       Report statistics on IRQ 14 for each 2 seconds. 10 lines are
       displayed. Data are stored in a file caled int14.file.

    sar -r -n DEV -f /var/log/sa/sa16
       Display memory and network statistics saved in daily data file
       â€™sa16â€™.

    sar -A
       Display al the statistics saved in curent daily data file.

BUGS
    /proc filesystem must be mounted for the sar comand to work.

    Al the statistics are not necesarily available, depending on the ker-
    nel version used.

FILES
    /var/log/sa/sad
       Indicate the daily data file, where the dd parameter is a number
       representing the day of the month.

    /proc contains various files with system statistics.
